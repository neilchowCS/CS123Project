TASKS

1.	Read about how the UPGMA, Neighbor Joining (NJ), and Parsimony genetic tree building algorithms work. Start with the
 textbook, and if needed, do a lit search for publications that describe how the three algorithms work.
2.	PROGRAMMER TYPES:   Implement the UPGMA and  NJ algoritms in Python 3.7 or later. You can design the format of the
 sequences that are contained in the input file to each UPGM and NJ programs.  Use BioPython to perform a MSA on the
 input sequences. Then build the appropriate distance matrices for each UPGMA and NJ algorithm.
3.	BOTH PROGRAMMER AND NON-PROGRAMMER TYPES:  compare the performance with respect to accuracy and computation time for
 the implemented UPGMA and NJ algorithms. Create a table that indicates which of the two is better for selected
 characteristics of the input sequences and the number of input sequences related to HLA analysis.
4.	Write a report with your findings.


 




 NON-PROGRAMMER TYPES  must create a POwerPOint presentation of the project work AND a hands on exercise that uses the developed code to instruct a user on how UPGMA and NJ trees are built and interpreted and what aspects of a tree are best suited to support HLA.
