HLA Sequence Comparison and Analysis

This project performs a comparison analysis of HLA sequences using traditional alignment methods (UPGMA and Neighbor Joining) to determine which HLA sequences match the most. This analysis can potentially be used to find the most matching organ for people or animals.

Files
finalProject.py: Main script to perform the analysis.
UPGMA.py: Script containing the implementation of the UPGMA algorithm.
NeighborJoining.py: Script containing the implementation of the Neighbor Joining algorithm.
GenerateMatrix.py: Script to calculate the distance matrix from sequence alignments.
hla_data.csv: Sample CSV file containing HLA typing data.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
numpy library
